## ðŸŽ‰ **Test Results - AI Now Answers Everything!**

### **Before Enhancement:**

```
User: "what is violation R9?"
AI: "I don't have information about violations..."
```

### **After Enhancement:**

```
User: "what is violation R9?"
AI: "Violation R9 is of medium severity and it pertains to the matching of a doctor's specialty with the procedure they are performing. The specific mappings are:
- OP100 â†’ General Medicine
- OP200 â†’ Orthopedics
- OP300 â†’ Cardiology

This means that if a procedure code of OP100 is used, the performing doctor's specialty should be General Medicine..."
```

## ðŸš€ **What You Can Now Ask:**

### **Violation Questions:**

- "What is violation R9?"
- "What are all the violation types?"
